	<span class="old ylw">W</span>hat was da Orta doing in Goa, and why would he write such a book? In the 16th century, the Kingdom of Portugal claimed to have conquered global trade: from the Azores to Brazil, from Luanda to Malindi, and from Goa to Macau to Japan, the Portuguese advertised dominance over coveted trade routes around the world. But the Portuguese were not really responsible for a majority of these trade routes. Portuguese men such as da Orta had merely entered a world of material, scientific, and cultural exchange that people from across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East had cultivated for over a millenium.
