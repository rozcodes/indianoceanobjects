		<h1>Diseases &amp; Illnesses</h1>	

		<p class= "main">In the 1500s, global trade and colonization increased the spread of highly contagious&#8212;and often deadly&#8212;diseases. With people across the world facing new illnesses for the first time, uncovering treatments for these conditions was a universal scientific goal. The comparison of various treatments from Asia, Europe, and elsewhere is a critical component of the <span class=red><i>Col&oacute;quios</i></span>. Although the book primarily described South Asian plants, da Orta digressed frequently to explain different treatments of the diseases that affected Portuguese readers in Goa, Europe, and around the world. As is typical of da Orta's writing, many of these comparisons are incomplete, and it is sometimes clear which treatments originated from which regions. So, how did Indians, Arabs, Europeans, Chinese, and others treat the same diseases, according to the <span class=red><i>Col&oacute;quios</span>? </i>Below is a composite analysis of 16th century global treatments.</p>

				<b>Climate Theory:</b> In the 1500s, Europeans believed that climate affected the body and medical treatments. Da Orta argues that Portugal and China, which have similar climates, should use similar treatments for syphilis. Goa, by contrast, is too hot to use the same treatment.

	 			<b>Politics of disease:</b> 
	 			In the 16th century, the origins of syphilis were unclear to Europeans, who chose to blame the disease on their neighbors and rivals. In the <i><span class=red> Col&oacute;quios</span>,</i> da Orta used the following terms to describe syphilis:	</p>
	 			 
	 				<ul class="castilianitch">
	 					<li><div><i>Gallic itch</div></li>

				<b>Background:</b> In the Early Modern era (and still today), many cultures believed that women suffered from special nervous or other conditions. Da Orta mentions several such conditions, including "passions of the mother" (<span class=red><i>paix&#245;es da madre</i></span>) and "nervous diseases" (<i><span class=red>enfermidades dos nerves</span></i>). (cont...) </p>

				<p class="description2">Whether these are genuine concerns about women's health or make-believe conditions, they constitute some of the only mentions of women in the <span class=red><i>Col&oacute;quios</span>.</i> <br><br>
				<b>Indian treatment:</b> Sweet flag. <br> Da Orta does not mention any equivalent Portuguese or other Asian treatments.
			
				</p>

	 			<p class="description3"><b>Childbirth:</b> The most prominent women's health issues to da Orta were pregnancy and childbirth. A community of expert Javan midwives in Goa reveals the global exchange of female scientific knowledge in the Indian Ocean region. Unfortunately, da Orta does not explain what techniques they used.</p>
